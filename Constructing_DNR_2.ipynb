    "# Overall Steps:\n",

    "The section that this notebook details is in bold.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Aquire satellite data (these codes are for GRACE and CHAMP, but modification should be simple)\n",
    "2. Construct a dataframe that contains all of the satellite epemeris data for the time period as the rows.\n",
    "    - This is done to make the act of looping (marginally) faster.  Opening and closing files is (sometimes) a slow task.\n",
    "    - These files are for 2002-2009\n",
    "3. Use the dataframe constructed in Step 2 to sample the MSISe00 and MSISe2. The data is concatenated as additional columns on the full satellite dataframes.\n",
    "    - The provided code uses Greg Lucas's pymsis module to sample both MSISe00 and MSISe2.\n",
    "    - save these sampled dataframes as new pickle files to be accessed.\n",
    "    - (if you run the data one year at a time, the dataframes will need to be combined)\n",
    "4. **Loop through each day of the period of interest and construct a day-to-night ratio for each day. Save the averged data and day-to-night ratios in a separate dataframe pickle.**\n",
    "    - This is done as a latitudinal average.  The code to do this is provided.\n",
    "    - Naming conventions can make this process difficult. \n",
    "5. Make plots to showcase your hardwork\n",
